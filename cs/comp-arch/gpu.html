    <h1>GPUs</h1>
    <body>This will be a documentation of my experience working with GPUs, 
      starting from learning CUDA.</body>

    <h3>Preamble</h3>
    <body>GPUs (graphic processing units) usually have many many cores and are 
    each heavily multithreaded, in-order, single-instruction issue processor. 
    Therefore, they are best for data intensive applications, preferably parallel 
    ones. On the other hand, they lack many key features used in everyday programmes.
    For example, GPUs do not have virtual memory, interrupts, or means to interact 
    with devices such as mouses. For these reasons, the CPU is still very much needed.</body>

    <body>As Machine Learning (more specifically, Deep Learning) becomes more and more 
    prevalent in our everyday lives, the need to train and run these models efficiently 
    increases. Fortunately enough, GPUs are quite suited for these tasks, which is one
    reason why this topic is rather important these days.</body>
